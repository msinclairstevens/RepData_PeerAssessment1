## Loading and preprocessing the data

### Download
Download the data.
I forked a github project via RStudio but the data can be downloaded programmatically from the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

```{r echo=TRUE}
setwd("~/WorkDirDataScience/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
if(!file.exists("activity.zip")){
  fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
  download.file(fileUrl,destfile="activity.zip",method="curl")
  dateDownloaded <- date()
  }else{  
  dateDownloaded <- file.info("activity.csv")$ctime
  }
print(paste("Date downloaded:", dateDownloaded, sep = " "))
```


### Unzip
Sometimes on my machine, zip files automatically unzip after downloading.  
Check for that before unzipping the data.
```{r echo=TRUE}
if(!file.exists("activity.csv")) {unzip("activity.zip")}

```

### Import
```{r echo=TRUE}
rawdata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

### Examine
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(rawdata)

```
The data is comprised of 17568 observations of three variables:  
- steps  
- date  
- interval   
 
The period of observation spans 61 days from October 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012; however, only 53 have data.  
The remaining 8 days are populated with NA values; NA values exist only in these 8 days.  

TODO
53 of the 61 dates have data. Eight are NA.  
 > length(table(subdate2$sumbydate))  
 [1] 53  

For each day, there are 288 observations (12x24). An observation is taken at 5 minute intervals.

```{r echo=TRUE}
head(rawdata)

```

### Clean
My personal preference is to convert data frames to data tables.

#### Create data table.

```{r echo=TRUE}
dtdata <- data.table(rawdata)
dtdata
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in
the dataset.

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.  
2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day.  

### Calculate sum, mean, and median by date.
```{r echo=TRUE}
calcsfordate <- summarize(group_by(dtdata,date),
                         totalfordate = sum(steps),
                         averagefordate = mean(steps),
                         medianfordate = as.double(median(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
                         )
```

### Examine the data aggregated by date.
```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(calcsfordate) 
table(calcsfordate$totalfordate) #53 days.
min(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
max(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
as.double(median(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE))
```

### Graph the total number of steps taken.
1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.  
 
For me challenge to this histogram is deciding what a meaningful number of breakpoints should be. 
The average total number of steps per day ranges from 41 to 21194, so I went with groups of 2000 steps. 
More than that results in too many empty "bins" in the histogram.

```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(calcsfordate$totalfordate, breaks=10, main="Spread of average number of steps each day", xlab="Average number of steps a day range from 41 to 21194", ylab="Number of observations in each range")
```

### Report the mean and median number of steps taken each day.
2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day.  

I couldn't tell what this question wanted so I answered it two ways. 
1. I took the mean and median of the 53 totals used for the histogram. This is so I could see how many daily totals were above and below average and get a sense of any skew.  
2. I calculated the mean and median for the total number of steps taken each day. As each day has 288 observations and the majority of them are zero (think eight hours of sleep and eight hours of sitting at work), each daily graph of steps is very skewed and the median is always zero.

```{r echo=TRUE}
mean(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
as.double(median(calcsfordate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE))
kable(select(calcsfordate, date, averagefordate, medianfordate))

```

The NA values are in entire days. So those days are NA.




## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

### Calculate sum, mean, and median by interval.
When aggregating data for the intervals, remove NAs since every interval has eight instances of NAs.
```{r echo=TRUE}
calcsforinterval <- summarize(group_by(dtdata,interval),
                             totalforinterval = sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE),
                             averageforinterval = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE),
                             medianforinterval = as.double(median(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
                             )


```

### Examine the data aggregated by interval.
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(calcsforinterval)
kable(calcsforinterval) #288 5-minute intervals in a 24-hour day
table(calcsforinterval$totalforinterval)
min(calcsforinterval$totalforinterval, na.rm=TRUE)
max(calcsforinterval$totalforinterval, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(calcsforinterval$totalforinterval, na.rm=TRUE)
as.double(median(calcsforinterval$totalforinterval, na.rm=TRUE))
```


### Plot average number of steps taken for each interval.
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r echo=TRUE}
with(calcsforinterval, plot(interval, averageforinterval, type="l", main="Daily Activity Pattern", xlab="5-minute intervals over a 24-hour period", ylab="Average number of steps per interval", xlim=c(0,2400), xaxt="n" ))
x <- axTicks(1) # Seems like you have to make it match the ticks.

axis(1, at=x, labels=c("00:00", "05:00", "10:00", "15:00", "20:00"))
```


### Find the maximum average number of steps in a 5-minute interval.
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?  
Answer from eyeballing data: 104      835        10927    206.1698113            19

```{r echo=TRUE}
max(calcsforinterval$averageforinterval) #206.1698 average number of steps
which(dtdata[,calcsforinterval$averageforinterval] == max(calcsforinterval$averageforinterval)) #index 104
dtdata[104,] 
calcsforinterval[104,] 

```

The 5-minute interval with the largest average number of steps begins at 08:35 AM; the average number of steps during that interval is a little more than 206.


## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing
values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce
bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with `NA`s)
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

### Determine the number of missing values.
Eight days (columns) have NAs so ALL the rows have NAs. Isn't it more interesting to know which of the columns(dates) have NAs?
8 days x 288 observatios = 2304 Total NAs values. This is confirmed in the summary.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(dtdata)
bad <- which(is.na(dtdata$steps)) # returns indices
print(length(bad))

```

### Proposed strategy for inferring values.
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Strategy: Use mean for each interval to fill in missing NA.  
Justification: Each interval represents a time of day so it makes more sense to me to use the mean of all the observations for a specific time of day than the mean of all the observations for a specific day. 

If I had more time, I might try it both ways to see if it makes any difference. Next time.


3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r echo=TRUE}
procdata <- dtdata %>%
  select(date, interval, steps) %>%
  group_by(interval)%>%
  mutate(avg = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

summary(procdata) 
min(procdata$steps)
max(procdata$steps)
```
TODO
What is this summary telling us because this doesn't match what we did before.
The maximum number of steps for any 5-minute interval is 806.
The average number of steps in any 5-minute interval is 37.38.


```{r echo=TRUE}

v <- length(procdata$steps) #iterate the length of the vector
for (i in 1:v) {
  if (!is.na(procdata$steps[i])==TRUE) {
    }else{
    procdata$steps[i] <- procdata$avg[i] 
    
  }
}

summary(procdata)
```
  Result: The median, mean, and max number of steps each day remains the same.  
  However, the additional 2304 observations set to the mean skews the results and changes the 3rd quartile.
This works singly. How to make it work in a loop?


    
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

### Calculate sum, mean, and median by date.
Perform the same aggregation on the data with imputed values as was done on the data with missing values.

```{r echo=TRUE}
calcsforprocdate <- summarize(group_by(procdata,date),
                         totalfordate = sum(steps),
                         averagefordate = mean(steps),
                         medianfordate = as.double(median(steps))
                         )
```                         

### Examine the data aggregated by date.
```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(calcsforprocdate) 
table(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate) #61 days.
min(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
max(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
as.double(median(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE))
```


### Graph the total number of steps taken.
```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, breaks=10, main="Spread of average number of steps each day", xlab="Average number of steps a day range from 41 to 21194", ylab="Number of observations in each range")
```
The number of observations in the midrange increased (by 8, the number of days for which the NA values were replaced with the mean value.)

### Report the mean and median number of steps taken each day

The eight days that showed an NA for the average number of steps a day ahould now show 37.38.  
The other days should have the same number.

TODO Why is the median still wrong

```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(select(calcsforprocdate, date, averagefordate, medianfordate))
min(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
max(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE)
as.double(median(calcsforprocdate$totalfordate, na.rm=TRUE))


```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the `weekdays()` function may be of some help here. Use
the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

1. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was created using **simulated data**:

### Determine the day of the week for each date.
```{r echo=TRUE}
dayofweek <- weekdays(as.numeric(procdata$date))
w <- length(dayofweek)
timespan <- factor(c(1:w), levels=c("weekday", "weekend"))
perioddata <- mutate(procdata, dayofweek, timespan)
table(perioddata$dayofweek) #check

weekend <-filter(perioddata, dayofweek == "Sat" | dayofweek == "Sun")%>%
   mutate(timespan = "weekend")
summary(weekend)   
   
weekday <- filter(perioddata, dayofweek != "Sat", dayofweek != "Sun")%>%
   mutate(timespan = "weekday")
summary(weekday)

perioddata2 <- rbind(weekday,weekend)%>%
  arrange(date)

summary(perioddata2)
```

### Calculate average steps across days.

```{r echo=TRUE}
calc <- summarize(group_by(perioddata2, date), average=mean(steps)) #This works but I don't think it's right
perioddata2 <- mutate(perioddata2, averagefordate=calc$average)

summary(perioddata2)
```       

```{r echo=TRUE}
qplot(interval, avg, data=perioddata2, facets= timespan ~ .) #This kinda works, data wrong
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
with(calcsforinterval, plot(interval, averageforinterval, type="l", main="Daily Activity Pattern", xlab="5-minute intervals over a 24-hour period", ylab="Average number of steps per interval", xlim=c(0,2400), xaxt="n" ))
x <- axTicks(1) # Seems like you have to make it match the ticks.

axis(1, at=x, labels=c("00:00", "05:00", "10:00", "15:00", "20:00"))
```
